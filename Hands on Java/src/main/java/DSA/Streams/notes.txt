Ways to create the stream : 
	1. Snames.stream();
	2. Arrays.stream(lang);
	3. Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5);
	4. Stream.generate(Math::random).limit(5);
	
Intermediate Operations : 
	1. Filter : --> takes predicate as input and filters the values based on the predicate.
	
	2. Map : --> takes Function as input, performs the transform operation and return the value.
	
	3. Sorted : 
		--> No args method : Sort the values
		--> Takes Comparator Interface as argument and sort the element 
		
	4. Reduce : 
		--> Takes (initial, binary operator) as args and returns a value of type.
		--> Takes (binary operator) as arg and returns a optional value of type.
		
	5. mapToInt : --> to convert Integer wrapper object to primitive int type and return IntStream
	6. mapToDouble :: --> to convert double wrapper object to primitive double type and return DoubleStream
	
Terminal Operations :
	1. Findfirst : --> finds the first element in the list
	2. max, sum, average, min --> can be used with primitive int.
	3. allMatch : --> takes predicate as arg and return true if all elements returns true by predicate
	4. anyMatch : --> takes predicate as arg and return true if any elements returns true by predicate
	5. Collectors.joining : --> Concatinate the string using the delimmter given
	6. Collectors.partitioningBy : --> takes predicate as arg and partition the element as true/false based on predicate condition
	7. Collectors.groupingBy : 
		--> takes Function as arg and group the element based on it
		--> takes function(key) and collector(value) as args
		--> take function, downstream, collector as arg
	8. Collectors.maxBy:--> take comparator Interface as arg and return the value (can be replaceble of max())
	9. Collectors.averagingDouble--> take function as arg and return average value
	10. Collectors.counting--> return occurance of the element
